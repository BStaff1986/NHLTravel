# NHLTravel

On February 9th, 2017, during the TSN broadcast of the Ottawa Senators game against the Dallas Stars, the TSN announcing team had a discussion about the travel itineraries of NHL teams. They asserted that Dallas had the worst travel schedule because their city was geographically isolated relative to other NHL cities. I thought it would be interesting to explore the data and see if their intuitions were correct.
