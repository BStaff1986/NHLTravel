# NHLTravel

On February 9th, 2017, during the TSN broadcast of the Ottawa Senators game against the Dallas Stars, the TSN announcing team had a discussion about the travel itineraries of NHL teams. They asserted that Dallas had the worst travel schedule because their city was geographically isolated relative to other NHL cities. I thought it would be interesting to explore the data and see if their intuitions were correct. 

I grabbed a dataset containing the 2016-2017 NHL season and another dataset that contained the geocoordinates for major world cities. Whenever a team traveled to a new city, the great circle distance between the two locations was calculated. Below is a table containing the total amount each team will travel in the 2016-2017 season (excluding pre- and post-season). 

|                  | Total Traveled | Avg. Distance | Furthest City | Distance | Closest City     | Distance |

After creating this table, I wanted to create a visual representation of each team's travel itinerary. Using matplotlib's animation features in conjunction with Basemap, I was able to create animated maps which traced the paths each team will take during the 2016-2017 season.
